Millions of elderly people and immigrants struggle with medication due to language barriers and forgetfulness. While doctors and pharmacies may send reminders, they often can't communicate in the patient's native language or dialect, leading to misunderstandings and missed doses.

CareLingo bridges this gap by providing a smart, automated reminder system that ensures patients never miss their medication—all in their own language!

  - ✅ Real-Time Voice Calls – We utilize the Twilio API to deliver medication reminders via automated voice calls
  - ✅ Multi-Language Support – Powered by Google Translate, our system speaks in the patient's native language
  - ✅ Custom Schedules – Uers can set reminders for specific hours and days based on each patient's needs
