CareLingo is a website deidicated to bridging language barriers and automate reminders. Many elderly and immigrants often forget or misunderstand their prescriptions. Doctors and pharmicies who remind patients might also reach out, but may not speak the language or correct dialect to get thier point across.

Using our platform, users can register as guardians and remind patients from their parents, grandparents and more about their medicine during specific hours and days. We use the Twilio API to make real voice calls with the GoogleTranslate API to speak in the patients own language.
